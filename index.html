            <br><p>Today we will bring you all together in getting yo know and explore in more depth the world
                of photography. First, let's gain knowledge on what photography actually is.
            </p>

            <br><p>Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually through a digital sensor or film,
                to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can also take pictures of wavelengths of light
                that are invisible to the human eye, including UV light, infrared, and radio.
            </p>

        <br><p>The first permanent photograph was taken in 1826, by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in France. 
            It shows the roof of a building illuminated by the sun.</p>
